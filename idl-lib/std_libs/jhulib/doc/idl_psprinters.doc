	The PostScript printers on the system are known to the IDL routine
	psinit through the environmental variable IDL_PSPRINTERS.

	IDL_PSPRINTERS names a file describing the Postscript
	printers available on the system.  The format of that file is:

	*  Any comments start with * as first char.
	*  Comment lines are ignored.
	print/queue=cps_ps			<-- print command.
	Postscript printer in terminal room.	<-- printer description.
	print/queue=cps_ps2			<-- next printer comand.
	Next postscript printer.		<-- its description.
	. . .					<-- as many pairs as needed.


	An example file for 3 printers is:

	*--- IDL Postscript printers description file  --------
	*--- R. Sterner, 22 May, 1990
	*--- STR VAX cluster   --------
	print/queue=cps_ps
	DEC Postscript printer in room 54 (Terminal room)
	print/queue=hp/form=post
	HP Postscript printer in room 119 (John's office)
	print/queue=alw/form=post
	Apple Laser Writer printer in room 304 (Ron & George's office)

	-=-=-=-=-  Some notes on the May 1995 upgrade to psinit  -=-=-=-=-

	Two major changes were made to psinit:

	* An additional method of selected a printer is available.

	* Color PostScript is now supported.

	In the past a PS printer was specified by its number as shown
	in the list given by psinit,/list.  This still works.  In addition
	a PS printer may now be specified by a tag name.  This can
	be any string in the printer description.  Printer descriptions are
	displayed by the command psinit,/list.  These are from the text file
	pointed to by the environmental variable IDL_PSPRINTERS.  It may be
	useful to edit these descriptions to add unique printer tags.
	If the given tag name does not occur in any of the printer descripton
	lines the psinit command is ignored.  If it occurs in more than
	one printer descripton line the first match is used but a warning
	message is given.

	Color PostScript is now supported by the addition of three new
	keywords:
	     /COLOR means do color PostScript (def is B&W).
	     /AUTOCOLOR means automatically set color mode for a
	       color PS printer.  Must have the word color in the
	       printer description line.
	     CFLAG=flag  Returned color flag: 0=B&W, 1=Color mode.
	/COLOR just attempts to place the printer in color mode.
	/AUTOCOLOR is more interesting.  It only sets color mode if
	the printer is actually a color printer.  This is determined
	by looking for the word color somewhere in the printer description
	line.  So this word must appear in the description for this
	keyword to work.  This keyword may be given to any printer,
	even if it's black and white.  The returned flag value, CFLAG,
	will be 0 for B&W and 1 for a color printer.  This is useful
	if the images must be treated differently for the two cases.
	For example, if the color image currently displayed in a graphics
	window is to be sent to a B&W printer it should first be converted
	to luminosity as follows:
	  a = tvrd()		; Read the current image.
	  tvlct,r,g,b,/get	; Read its color table.
	  lum = ROUND(.3*r + .59*g + .11*b)<255   ; Find image brightness.
	  a = lum(a)		; Convert color image to B&W.
	The converted image, a, should print ok on a B&W printer.
