  details.txt = more details on the operation of LIBR

  LIBR handles a rather large number of files, for some operations nearly 40.
  The most obvious file is the routine to be added, moved, or deleted.  Other
  files are used to document the contents and history of each library.
  Modified files are first backed up.  The files are described below.

  xxx.pro     The routine in question, where xxx is the routine name.
  backup.bak  A copy of xxx.pro before it is moved.  Deleted routines
              are actually just moved to the trash directory.
  alph.one    A alphabetical list of one line descriptions of all routines
              currently in the library.  Used by the LINER utility to
              locate routines by keywords in their one line descriptions.
  alph.bak    The last version of alph.one.
  cat.one     Same as alph.one except it is meant to be organized into
              categories.  If a one line description is already in cat.one
              it is overwritten.  Otherwise it is placed at the front of
              cat.one so you can move it to the correct category (or
              categories) with a text editor.  Do this occasionally.
  cat.bak     The last version of cat.one.
  newlist.txt A list of all routines added since newlist.txt was created.
              This may be useful if you want to back up new routines or
              something similar.  After such a back up just delete this
              file, it will be created again with new routines since that time.
  newlist.bak The last version of newlist.txt.
  release_notes.txt  This file is manually edited any time a routine is
              added, moved, or deleted.  It is a history of the library
	      and can be very useful.
  release_notes.bak  The last version of release_notes.txt.

  That is 10 files.  The same files occur in both the main and mirror
  directories for a total of 20 files.  The most complex operation is
  a move (a delete is just a move to the trash directory) and involves
  38 files (since backup.bak files are not needed in the target directories).

  LIBR will do most of the work transparently to the user, except for
  added comments to the release_notes.txt files (in both the source and
  destination directories for a move).
