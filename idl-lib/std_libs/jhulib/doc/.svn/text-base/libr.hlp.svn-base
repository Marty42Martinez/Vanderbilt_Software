  LIBR --- IDL Librarian (for IDL on fast UNIX computers)

  Helps maintain multiple IDL libraries.

  LIBR has the following main functions:
    ADD ------- Add a new routine to a library
    MOVE ------ Move a routine from one library to another
    DELETE ---- Delete a routine from a library
    EXAMINE --- Examine a library listing and typing routines
    SEARCH ---- Search a library for references to a routine.

  This librarian is most useful if you adhere to the guidelines listed
  under help entry for Built in help below.

  For each main library LIBR can optionally also update an identical
  mirror library.  Main and mirror library directories are specified
  in a file called .idl_libs in your home directory.

  Your preferred text editor is specified in the file called .idl_editor
  in your home directory.

  There are several other .idl_* files needed in your home directory,
  see the help entry for .idl_* files below for more info.

  A rather large number of auxiliary files are maintained,
  see the help entry Operational details below.
